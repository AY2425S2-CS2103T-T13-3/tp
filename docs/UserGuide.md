2. Download the latest `recruitintel.jar` from our [releases page](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/releases).

3. Create a dedicated folder for RecruitIntel:
    * Choose a location with at least 1GB of free space
    * Ensure you have write permissions for this location
    * Copy the downloaded JAR file into this folder

4. Launch RecruitIntel:
    * Open your terminal/command prompt
    * Navigate to the folder containing the JAR file: `cd path/to/folder`
    * Run the application: `java -jar recruitintel.jar`
    * A screen similar to the one below should appear within 5 seconds:

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 j/Software Engineer tm/IOS Development` : Adds a candidate named `John Doe` applying for a `Software Engineer` position  in the `IOS Development` team.

    * `note 1 Strong backend experience, but lacks iOS exposure.` : Adds a note to the 1st candidate in the list.

    * `interview 1 2025-04-01 10:00 40` : Schedules a 40-minute interview for the 1st candidate, scheduled at 10:00 AM on April 1, 2025.

    * `sort` : Sorts the candidates by ascending order of their scheduled interview time.

    * `undo` : Reverts the most recent change (e.g. adding, deleting, or editing a candidate).

    * `clear` : Deletes all candidates.


6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Replace words in `UPPER_CASE` with the required information.
    * Example: in `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual name like `add n/John Doe`

* Items in square brackets `[...]` are optional.
    * Example: `[t/TAG]` can be used as `t/Python` or omitted entirely

* Items with `…`​ can be used multiple times or omitted.
    * Example: `[t/TAG]…​` allows:
        * No tags: ` `
        * One tag: `t/Python`
        * Multiple tags: `t/Python t/Java t/AWS`

* You can enter the information in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* The `sort` command only sorts **currently displayed** candidates (i.e. those shown by the last command such as `classify`, `find`, etc.).

* When using `classify` to filter candidates, it will show only candidates that match all of your search criteria.
  Example: `classify t/python tm/Design` shows candidates who have both Python skills and applied for a position in the Design team.

* For simple commands like `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, any extra information you type will be ignored.
  Example: typing `help 123` works the same as typing just `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
