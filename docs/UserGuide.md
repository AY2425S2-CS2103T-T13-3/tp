This sorting ensures that the most relevant contacts for your search terms appear at the top of the results.

When a new semester begins, any courses your friends were taking in the previous semester will be automatically moved to their "Previous Courses" section, and their current courses list will be cleared. This saves you time and effort as you no longer need to manually update each contact.

**Important notes:**
- The archival is based on your computer's system date and occurs when you start the application.
